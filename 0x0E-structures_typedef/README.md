# C - Structures, typedef
### What are structures, when, why and how to use them?
	- A structure is a user defined data type available
	  in C that allow to combine data items of different kinds

	- We use structures when we need to group a related data items
	  of different types as we can organize the data in a way that
	  makes it easy to understand and manipulate. 
	  Example: a record of an employee's name, age, and salary 
	  would be a good candidate for a structure

	- An Example of how we can use struct:
		```c
		struct struct_name
		{
			data_type data_name;
			data_type data_name;
			data_type data_name;
		}
		```
